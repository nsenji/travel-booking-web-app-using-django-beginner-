This is a web application that enables travellers to make booking to there favourite destinations 
around the world.

Emphasis is mainly on the back end use of django and little emphasis is put on the front end

I managed to integrate the functionality of joining pages and user log in and logout.

Also much emphasis was put the making the pages dynamic such that once detinations are added automatically to the page
through the admin site

The data is stored in the postgres database which i also succesfully linked.
